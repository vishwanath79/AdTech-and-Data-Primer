# Chapter 4: User Identification

On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog—unless you have a persistent identifier. User identification is the holy grail of digital advertising. If you can't identify a user across sites and devices, you can't target them, you can't frequency cap, and you certainly can't attribute a sale to an ad view.

For two decades, the third-party cookie was the king of identity. Now, the king is dying, and the kingdom is in chaos.

This chapter explores how we identify users today, how that's changing, and what the future of identity looks like in a privacy-first world.

## What's Covered

### [Cookies: The Old Standard](./01-Cookies.md)

How cookies actually work. First-party vs. third-party. How they were used to build massive cross-site profiles and why they became the backbone of the open web's economy.

### [The Crumbling Cookie](./02-Crumbling_Cookies.md)

Why cookies are going away. Browser restrictions (ITP, ETP), regulatory pressure, and consumer backlash. What happens when the primary tracking mechanism disappears?

### [Alternative IDs](./03-Alternative_IDs.md)

The industry's desperate scramble for a replacement. Universal IDs (UID2.0), hashed emails, probabilistic fingerprinting, and the rise of "walled gardens" that own their own identity graphs.

### [Device vs. People](./04-Device_vs_People.md)

The challenge of cross-device tracking. You are one person, but to an ad server, you are a phone, a laptop, a tablet, and a smart TV. Stitching these identities together is difficult, inaccurate, and essential.

## Why This Matters

Identity is the currency of targeting. Without it, programmatic advertising reverts to contextual targeting (showing car ads on car sites).

If you're a data scientist, the quality of your "user_id" field determines the quality of your models. If that ID is unstable, short-lived, or non-existent, your churn models, LTV calculations, and attribution logic fall apart.

We are in the middle of the biggest structural shift in the history of digital advertising. Understanding identity resolution isn't just technical trivia—it's survival knowledge for the post-cookie era.
