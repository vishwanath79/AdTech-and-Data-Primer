# Chapter 2: Core Concepts

AdTech is often described with buzzwords, but beneath the jargon lies a logical system of data flows, user interactions, and financial transactions. Before we get into the algorithms and auction dynamics, we need to understand the basic building blocks.

This chapter lays the foundation. We'll define what AdTech actually is (beyond just "showing ads"), map out how data moves between systems, and explain the fundamental metrics that everyone uses but few truly understand.

## What's Covered

### [What is AdTech?](./01-What_is_AdTech.md)

Defining the landscape. It's not just marketing; it's the technology infrastructure that connects advertisers to publishers and users. We'll look at the core purpose: matching the right ad to the right user at the right time (and price).

### [Key Dataflows](./02-Key_Dataflows.md)

How does an ad actually get from a server to your screen? We'll trace the request lifecycle—from the user visiting a page, to the ad request, the bidding process, and finally the rendering of the creative. Understanding this flow is critical for debugging and optimization.

### [Impressions, Clicks, and Conversions](./03-Impressions_Clicks_Conversions.md)

The currency of digital advertising. Everyone counts them, but definitions vary. We'll break down what counts as an impression, why clicks are a flawed metric, and how conversions are attributed (often inaccurately).

## Why This Matters

You can't optimize what you don't understand. Many data professionals jump straight into "machine learning for bidding" without grasping the underlying mechanics of how an ad is served or how a conversion is tracked.

If you don't know how the data is generated, you can't effectively analyze it. These core concepts are the assumptions built into every dataset you'll encounter in this industry. Misunderstanding them leads to wrong conclusions, wasted budget, and flawed products.

This is where we stop nodding along to acronyms and start understanding the engineering reality behind them.
