# Chapter 6: Data in AdTech

Data is the "oil" of the digital economy—a cliché, but true. In AdTech, data determines who sees an ad, how much it costs, and whether it worked. But not all data is created equal.

From declared data (what you tell a site) to inferred data (what a model guesses about you), the ecosystem is awash in segments, profiles, and graphs. Storing, managing, and activating this data requires specialized infrastructure.

This chapter covers the types of data used in advertising and the massive platforms built to wrangle it.

## What's Covered

### [Data Types: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Party](./01-Data_Types.md)

The hierarchy of data value. First-party data is gold (you own it). Third-party data is... complicated (and often low quality). We'll define the differences and why the industry is pivoting hard to first-party strategies.

### [DMPs (Data Management Platforms)](./02-DMPs.md)

The traditional engine for audience segmentation. DMPs aggregate third-party cookies to build audiences for ad targeting. We'll look at how they work and why they are struggling in a cookie-less world.

### [CDPs (Customer Data Platforms)](./03-CDPs.md)

The new challenger. CDPs focus on known, first-party PII (emails, phone numbers) to build persistent customer profiles. We'll explain why every brand suddenly wants a CDP and how it differs from a DMP.

### [Segmentation and Targeting](./04-Segmentation_Targeting.md)

How data becomes an audience. Lookalike modeling, behavioral segmentation, and demographic targeting. How do we take raw event logs and turn them into "Auto Intenders" or "High Net Worth Individuals"?

## Why This Matters

You can have the best bidding algorithm in the world, but if your input data is garbage, your output will be garbage.

Understanding the provenance and quality of data is crucial. "Third-party intent data" sounds fancy, but often it just means "someone visited a car blog 30 days ago." Knowing the difference between deterministic (proven) and probabilistic (guessed) data prevents you from making expensive mistakes.

As privacy regulations tighten, the ability to manage and activate first-party data (CDPs) is becoming more valuable than renting audiences (DMPs). This chapter helps you navigate that transition.
