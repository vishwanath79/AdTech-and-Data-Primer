# AI & Machine Learning in AdTech

Artificial intelligence has gone from AdTech buzzword to AdTech backbone in less than a decade. What used to require armies of analysts manually tweaking campaigns now happens automatically, in milliseconds, at scale.

But AI in advertising isn't magic—it's math applied to massive datasets. And like any powerful tool, it can be used brilliantly or disastrously depending on who's wielding it.

## What This Section Covers

This chapter walks through the real applications of AI in AdTech—not the marketing hype, but the actual models, algorithms, and trade-offs that power modern advertising platforms.

### [01 - AI Applications](./01-AI_Applications.md)

Where AI actually adds value in advertising:
- Audience segmentation that finds patterns humans miss
- Creative generation and optimization at scale
- Fraud detection that saves millions
- Customer lifetime value prediction
- Conversational AI for ad interactions

Plus practical code examples showing how to implement each one.

### [02 - Algorithmic Bidding](./02-Algorithmic_Bidding.md)

How machines decide what to bid in millisecond auctions:
- Basic bidding algorithms (conversion probability × target CPA)
- Target CPA, Target ROAS, and other bidding strategies
- Multi-armed bandit approaches for exploration vs exploitation
- Real-time bid adjustments based on context, budget, and competition

Manual bidding is dead. This explains what replaced it.

### [03 - Predictive Analytics](./03-Predictive_Analytics.md)

Fortune-telling with data:
- Conversion probability prediction for smarter targeting
- Churn prediction to win back customers before they leave
- Budget pacing forecasts to avoid spending too fast or too slow
- Time series forecasting for seasonal trends
- Lookalike modeling to find new high-value customers

With working implementations you can adapt for your own use cases.

## Why This Matters

AI in AdTech isn't optional anymore. Google, Facebook, Amazon—the platforms dominating digital advertising all run on sophisticated ML systems. If you're competing without algorithmic optimization, you're bringing a knife to a drone fight.

But AI also amplifies problems. Biased data creates discriminatory targeting. Engagement optimization can become manipulation. Privacy-invading inference happens invisibly. The same tools that help you find your ideal customer can be weaponized for harm.

Understanding how these systems work—both technically and ethically—is crucial whether you're building them, using them, or trying to regulate them.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this section, you'll understand:

1. **What AI can do** (and what it can't) in advertising
2. **How bidding algorithms work** under the hood
3. **Where predictions add value** and where they fall short
4. **Practical implementations** you can use or adapt

The focus is on practical knowledge backed by working code. Not theoretical CS papers, not marketing fluff—actual implementations you can run, understand, and modify.

## A Word of Caution

AI in AdTech is powerful. Use it responsibly.

Every model you deploy, every optimization you implement, every audience you target—those are choices with consequences. Optimize for long-term value, not just short-term metrics. Build systems you'd be comfortable explaining publicly. Draw ethical lines and stick to them.

The industry has a trust problem. The technology can be part of the solution or part of the problem. That choice is yours.

Let's dive in.
