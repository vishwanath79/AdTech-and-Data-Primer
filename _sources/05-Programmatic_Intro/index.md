# Chapter 5: Introduction to Programmatic Advertising

Programmatic advertising is what happens when you turn media buying into an algorithm. Instead of humans negotiating prices and manually placing ad orders, software handles everything—finding inventory, evaluating users, calculating bids, and executing purchases in milliseconds.

It's efficient, scalable, and completely opaque. Most advertisers using programmatic platforms have no idea how the auctions actually work, who's taking a cut, or why their ads show up where they do.

This chapter demystifies the programmatic ecosystem—what it is, how real-time bidding works, and who all the players are taking their slice of your ad budget.

## What's Covered

### [What is Programmatic?](./01-What_is_Programmatic.md)

The basics: what programmatic advertising actually means, how it differs from traditional ad buying, and why it took over the industry. Spoiler: automation wins because humans can't evaluate thousands of impressions per second.

### [Real-Time Bidding (RTB) Explained](./02-RTB.md)

How millisecond auctions work. When you load a webpage, advertisers bid on the right to show you an ad before the page finishes loading. This is the technical and economic foundation of programmatic advertising.

### [DSPs, SSPs, Ad Exchanges, and DMPs](./03-Programmatic_Players.md)

The ecosystem is full of acronyms. DSPs buy ads. SSPs sell them. Ad exchanges run auctions. DMPs provide data. Each one takes a cut. This section breaks down who does what and how they all connect.

## Why This Matters

Programmatic advertising accounts for the majority of digital ad spending now. If you're working with digital advertising data, you're working with programmatic data—whether you know it or not.

Understanding programmatic isn't just about knowing the acronyms. It's about understanding:
- **How auctions determine prices** (and why CPMs vary wildly)
- **Where your ad budget actually goes** (hint: less to publishers than you'd think)
- **How targeting decisions get made** in real-time
- **Why transparency is nearly impossible** in programmatic ecosystems

The platforms want you to trust the black box. This chapter opens it up so you can see what's inside—and question whether the system is working in your favor or theirs.

By the end, you'll understand how programmatic transformed advertising from a relationship business into an algorithmic one. Whether that's good or bad depends on which side of the transaction you're on.
